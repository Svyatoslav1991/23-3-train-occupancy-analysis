# 23-3-train-occupancy-analysis
There are only 10 cars on the train. Each of these cars can accommodate up to 20 passengers - this is their optimal number. Analyze the number of people in each carriage and first report on overfilled carriages, then on carriages with empty passenger seats. Finally, output the total number of passengers in all cars.
When starting the program, the user enters the number of passengers in each carriage. Comments about wagons should be output to the standard console.
When performing a task, you cannot use for-loops directly, only indirectly, through macros.
